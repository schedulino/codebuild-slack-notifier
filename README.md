# codebuild-slack-notifier

AWS Lambda to send Slack notifications for CodeBuild events.

## Install

A valid Slack oauth token needs to be stored as a secure string in the SSM parameter store as `/codebuild-slack-notifier/slack_token` and also valid Slack channels needs to be stored as a string in the SSM parameter store as `/codebuild-slack-notifier/${projectName}_channels`.

> NOTE: The slack oauth needs to have follow permission scopes: `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write:bot`

Then run:

```shell
npm install
npm run deploy
```

With AWS credentials that have access to read from SSM and deploy a lambda.

Additionally, you can modify the deploy command by adding additional serverless arguments:

```shell
npm run deploy -- --stage production --region us-east-1
```

## Configuration

Using `chamber`, you can set the corresponding Slack channel(s) for each codebuild project.

```
chamber write codebuild-slack-notifier {project_name}_channels {slack_channel}
```
